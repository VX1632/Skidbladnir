# üìä MicroK8s Dashboard Access Guide

This guide helps you access the Kubernetes Dashboard for a MicroK8s cluster, both locally and remotely, and troubleshoot common port and proxy issues.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Dashboard Access

On the MicroK8s host node (e.g., `k8s-odin`), run:

```bash
microk8s dashboard-proxy
```

You should see output like:


```bash
Dashboard will be available at https://127.0.0.1:10443
```

Use the following token to login:
<your-token-here>

Open this URL in a browser on the same machine:
```bash
https://127.0.0.1:10443
```
Paste the token when prompted to log in.
üåê Remote Dashboard Access (via SSH Tunnel)

To access the dashboard remotely (e.g., from your laptop fenrir), establish an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 10443:127.0.0.1:10443 -p <custom-port> user@<ip-address>
```

Then, on your local machine, open:

```bash
https://127.0.0.1:10443
```

Login with the token output from the microk8s dashboard-proxy command.
üõ† Troubleshooting
üîç Check for Running Proxy Processes

```bash
ps aux | grep dashboard-proxy
```

Expected Output Example:

vxadmin  12345  0.1  0.2 123456 23456 ? Ss 10:12  0:01 /snap/microk8s/...

‚ùå Kill a Stale Dashboard Proxy

```bash
kill <PID here>
```
# or, if it doesn't stop:

```bash
kill -9 <PID here>
```

üßµ Port 10443 Already in Use?

Check what‚Äôs occupying the port:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :10443
```

Example Output:

COMMAND   PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
kubectl  123400  vxadmin  9u  IPv4  123456     0t0  TCP *:10443 (LISTEN)

Kill the process:

```bash
kill -9 <PID here>
```

üîÅ Restart the Dashboard Proxy

After clearing any issues, restart:

```bash
microk8s dashboard-proxy
```

Then open:

```bash
https://127.0.0.1:10443
```

Log in with the token provided.
‚úÖ Tips

    Keep your SSH tunnel open while using the dashboard.

    Avoid exposing the dashboard to the public internet.

    For convenience, consider adding an SSH config entry or wrapper script for repeated use.
