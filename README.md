# Skidbladnir

**Skidbladnir** is a modular Kubernetes deployment framework built for **resilience**, **stealth**, and **adaptability**. Inspired by Norse mythology’s legendary foldable ship, it delivers infrastructure that **travels light but carries heavy**, optimized for both agility and power.

Designed as the public-facing interface to **Naglfar**, a private, self-reliant infrastructure, Skidbladnir orchestrates **modular, portable, and secure deployments** across diverse hardware environments, including compact ARM-based clusters and high-performance x86 systems.

> ⚓️ **Naglfar**, in contrast, functions as a spectral “ghost ship”: a hardened, autonomous Kubernetes cluster that hosts sensitive workloads, encrypted services, and internal routing. It integrates:
> - Advanced VPN endpoint security  
> - Containerized secrets management  
> - Zero-trust network segmentation  
> - Beacon-based signaling for asynchronous, low-profile operations  

Together, Skidbladnir and Naglfar enable:
- **Seamless migration** and controlled exposure of services  
- **Robust failover** across hybrid, edge, and cloud environments  
- Deployment in **adversarial or low-trust networks**

This architecture is ideal for **edge computing**, **security research**, and **dynamic staging environments**.

## 📓 Project Notes

This project was built and maintained as part of a self-hosted homelab environment, simulating production-grade orchestration, networking, and security workflows on real hardware.

🏠 Originally designed and deployed in a hybrid homelab environment using Raspberry Pi 5 and x86 infrastructure.
